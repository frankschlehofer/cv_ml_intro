Basic OpenCV implementation to track hand movement for drawing purposes.

Hand Functionality:
- Extend pointer finger while pinching thumb and middle finger together to draw
- Pinch all 5 fingers together to clear drawings
  
Keyboard Functionality:
- Press Q to exit window
- Press C to clear drawing

Tools Used:
- OpenCV for camera capture
- MediaPipe for all hand tracking and image overlays

Number Recognition Model trained on MNIST data.
- Model needs more work, very innaccurate when predicting drawn numbers.
